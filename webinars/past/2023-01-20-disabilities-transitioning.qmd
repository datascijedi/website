## Overview

This webinar will provide an overview of resources that help job seekers with disabilities navigate transitions between school and work, as well as testimonials.
Many statisticians alternate between holding a professional position and attending educational programs, often leading to multiple transitions between school and work throughout one's career trajectory.
This webinar brings together experts on accommodations for transitions to work as well as statisticians with disabilities who have experienced transitions between school and work during their careers.
A Q&A and discussion period will follow the presentations.
All are welcome to attend the webinar
