Our committees are actively working to promote justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) principles in statistics and data science. 

* The **Awards Committee** is focused on diversifying nominations for the American Statistical Associationâ€™s (ASA) Fellows Award as well as other awards for statisticians within and outside of the ASA.

* The **Communications Committee** manages the JEDI Outreach Group social media channels and website, advertises JEDI-related events and opportunities, and coordinates the JEDI Corner in *Amstat News* [(Link to JEDI Corner archives)](jedi-corner.qmd).

* The **Liaison Committee** collaborates with other organizations within and outside of the ASA to develop and maintain best practices for JEDI in our scientific communities.

* The **Professional Development Committee** provides opportunities for members to learn about JEDI-related issues and how to develop communities that are just, equitable, diverse and inclusive.

* The **Program Committee** develops and contributes programming that promotes a just, equitable, diverse and inclusive statistics community and addresses areas of statistical study that face JEDI-related implications. This committee will work to incorporate and/or sponsor JEDI-related programming in statistical conferences.

* The **Students and Young Professionals Committee** provides an opportunity for students and young professionals (within five years of their highest degree) to gather and convene to discuss their JEDI-related experiences and concerns. This committee can further pass along ideas and collaborate with the other JEDI Outreach Group committees to publicize and address their related concerns and interests.
