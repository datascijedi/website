Our committees are actively working to promote justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) principles in statistics and data science. 

The **Awards** committee is focused on diversifying nominations for the American Statistical Associationâ€™s (ASA) Fellows Award as well as other awards for statisticians within and outside of the ASA.

The **Communications** committee manages the JEDI Outreach Group social media channels and website, coordinates the JEDI Corner in *Amstat News*, and advertises JEDI-related events and opportunities.

The **Liaison** committee collaborates with other organizations within and outside of the ASA to develop and maintain best practices for JEDI in our scientific communities.

The **Professional Development** committee provides opportunities for members to learn about JEDI-related issues and how to develop communities that are just, equitable, diverse and inclusive.

The **Program Committee** develops and contributes programming that promotes a just, equitable, diverse and inclusive statistics community and addresses areas of statistical study that face JEDI-related implications. This committee will work to incorporate and/or sponsor JEDI-related programming in statistical conferences.

The **Students and Young Professionals** committee provides an opportunity for students and young professionals (within five years of their highest degree) to gather and convene to discuss their JEDI-related experiences and concerns. This committee can further pass along ideas and collaborate with the other JEDI Outreach Group committees to publicize and address their related concerns and interests.
