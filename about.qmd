In 2021, the American Statistical Association established the **Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Outreach Group**. JEDI is a community of statisticians and data scientists committed to communication, programming, and professional development to advance a society that values all people. The group considers all dimensions of diversity, including but not limited to race, gender, sexual orientation, age, persons with disabilities, and socioeconomic status. JEDI provides a diverse and inclusive environment that embraces all members and educates our community about JEDI-related matters. The group is further committed to promoting statistical methods to measure and address inequities and injustices in our society.
